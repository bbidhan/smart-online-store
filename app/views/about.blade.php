    <p>An online store with a difference: its smarter!<br>
Besides obvious features such as responsive design, easy checkout, secure backend, etc. that any decent online store cannot do without, we implement various machine learning algorithms in order to specifically group certain products together and make buying things easy for the customer.
<br>Moreover, our users will be logging into the site with their personal account before shopping. This allows us to personalize the shopping experience even more, displaying their favourite items, and items that might interest them on the homepage itself.</p>
